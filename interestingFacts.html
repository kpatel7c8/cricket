                The longest cricket match took place in 1939 between England and South Africa in Durban. It lasted over 9 days and 46 hours of play but ended in a draw because the English players needed to catch a train to ultimately board a ship back home. While such timeless Tests were common at the time to force a result in the  match (to avoid a draw), this was the last such instance after which a hard time limit was enforced for all cricket matches.

                The two most common causes for pausing or suspending a cricket match are rain and bad light. Being an outdoor sport, there is no escaping the elements but the long nature of the game, especially Test cricket, is particularly influenced by weather conditions. Grass or wear on the pitch influence player selection and tactics while weather forecast often adds drama and unpredictability when a team is chasing a target or trying to save a match on the 5th day of a Test match.

                The first ever cricket match between two countries was played between the US and Canada on September 1844 in New York. It was the first time any two nations played a sporting event in modern history. Canada won the match by 23 runs. Growing popularity of another similar sport - Baseball - meant that cricket never took off in the US.

                Cricket  featured in two successive Olympics in 1890 and 1900 in Athens and Paris respectively. In present times, cricket's participation on the world's biggest stage is marred by issues such as lack of initiative from cricket's governing body and scheduling as well as logistical issues.

                England and Australia are the oldest Test playing nations and their rivalry dates back to 1882. The two countries have played each other in a bi-annual series, known as The Ashes, since then. Another famous rivalry is between India and Pakistan. Due to complex geopolitical tensions between them, the two nations face each other exclusively in global events and their match is often the most anticipated match of the tournament.

                There can be no discussion about cricket without mentioning its greatest player - Donald Bradman. Bradman played 52 Test matches for Australia from 1928-1948 and scored 6996 runs including 29 centuries at an average of <strong>99.94</strong>. For comparison, the next highest Test batting average is less than 62 and all but the top 5 players average less than 60 in men's Test cricket.

                All cricket matches until mid 1970s were played in white uniforms. A different colored uniform kit for each team was first introduced in 1977 World Series cricket and since then it has been adopted in the shorter formats. Players in Test cricket still wear all whites &agrave; la Wimbledon and up until 2019 they did not have their name or number on the jerseys. And they dare complain Test cricket is dying!
