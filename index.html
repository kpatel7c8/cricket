        <h1>What is Cricket?</h1>
        <p>
          Cricket is a team sport which can trace its roots back to 17th century England. It is played on an oval shaped field with a bat and ball between two teams of 11 players each. The cricket field is oval with a rectangular "pitch" in the middle. The teams takes turn batting where the batters try to score the most runs while the opposite team tries to get them out.

          From its humble begginings as a children's game played on sheep-grazed land in South East England, cricket underwent many transformations to ultimately spread globally along with the expansion of the British Empire. Today it has a presence in over 100 countries and  it is statistically the second most followed sport only behind football although its popularity is concentrated in only a handful of coutries. There are three distinct forms of cricket played internationally: Test cricket, ODI, and T20 with the latter  being the newest and shortest form of the game. While cricket has been  mostly played by men, women's cricket has grown steadily and commands great interest since the emergence of shorter forms of the game.
