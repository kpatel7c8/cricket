          <h2>Cricket Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Cricket, at its heart, is a very simple game. The team batting first tries to score the maximum number of runs (points). The objective of the fielding is to restrict batters by getting them out and stop them from scoring runs. After a set number of balls, or if in case all the batter in the team get out, the teams switch roles and the team batting second needs to score one run more than their opponents to win the match.

          <h2>Cricket Terminology</h2>
          <p>
            Let us look at some terminology which will give some additional background information and  explain the game in more detail.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Allout: When all batters in a team are out.</li>
            <li>All-rounder: A player who can both bat and bowl making that player very valuable to the team.</li>
            <li>Appeal: When fielding team asks the umpire to dismiss the batter. The umpire cannot give the batter out unless there is an appeal.</li>
            <li>Batting order: The order in which the batters bat. A specialist batter will bat in the top 5 or 6 followed usually by wicket keeper, any all-rounders and then the bowlers.</li>
            <li>Bouncer: A ball that lands near the middle of the pitch before rising high towards the batter making it uncomfortable to face. It is usually used by fast bowlers to surprise or intimidate the batter.</li>
            <li>Boundary: A rope demarcating the field of play.</li>
            <li>Bowled: When a batter is out due to the bowler striking the stumps.</li>
            <li>Caught: When a batter is out due to the ball being caught by any of the fielders after being hit in air before it touches the ground.</li>
            <li>Century: When a batter reaches a score of 100 runs in an innings. Scoring a century is considered one of the highest achievement in batsmanship as it requires good control and temparament over a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Crease: A line painted near the stumps on either side of the pitch.</li>
            <li>DRS (Decision Review System): A modern innovation in cricket where a batter or fielding captain can ask the TV umpire to review the decision made by an on-field umpire.</li>
            <li>Draw: A fourth type of result in the longer form of the game when a game ends without a clear winner. The other three results are a win, loss, or a tie</li>
            <li>Duck: When a batter is dismissed without scoring a run.</li>
            <li>Four: Runs awarded to the batter for hitting a ball that reaches the boundary after touching the ground at least once.</li>
            <li>Full toss: A type of delivery where the ball reaches the batter without touching the ground.</li>
            <li>Hat-trick: When a bowler dismisses three batters in three consecutive deliveries.</li>
            <li>Hit wicket: When a batter is dismissed by unintentionally hitting the stumps in an attempt to hit the ball.</li>
            <li>Innings: A period of play when one of the teams is batting. Shorter forms of the game have 2 innings with each team batting once while longest form allows upto 4 innings with each team being able to bat upto two times.</li>
            <li>Leg before wicket (LBW): When a batter is dismissed with the ball hitting any part of the batter's body and, in umpire's judgement, the ball was on its way on to hit the stumps.</li>
            <li>Maiden: When a bowler bowls a set of six legal consecutive deliveries (called an over) without conceding a single run to the batting team.</li>
            <li>No-ball: An illegal delivery when a bowler oversteps the crease when bowling. A batsman can only be dissmissed run-out when a bowler balls a no-ball. The bowler needs to bowl again and his team is penalized by conceding one extra run to the batting team.</li>
            <li>Six: Runs awarded to the batter for hitting a ball that reaches the boundary without touching the ground.</li>
            <li>Tie: Third type of result in a cricket when a match ends with scores level. Depending on the tournament rules, both teams can bat an extra over to determine a winner in shorter forms of the game.</li>
            <li>Wicket: Can be used in various contexts to either mean stumps, pitch, or the dismissal of a batter.</li>
            <li>Wicket-keeper: An illegal delivery when a bowler bowls a delivery that is out of reach for a batsman to hit. The bowler needs to bowl again and his team is penalized by conceding one extra run to the batting team.</li>
            <li>Yorker: A type of delivery that is bowled very close to the batter often used in shorter formats to restrict a batter from scoring runs.</li>
          </ul>
