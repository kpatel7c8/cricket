              <p>While the first written record of a cricket match dates back to the year 1611, the exact origins of the game remain undiscovered. According to some historians, it evolved from a game called Creag in England as early as 1300s while others believe it came from a French game called Croquet in the 15th century.</p>

              <p>By the early 1600s, cricket had taken firm roots in South England with the game gaining interest in adults. With serious interest from working adults, games were regularly held on Sundays and spread among the elites and commoners alike.</p>

              <h2>18th Century</h2>
              <p>In the 18th century, many clubs were being formed in England to organize matches. In 1787, one such club named Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in London. MCC formalized the laws governing the game which were later adopted by the rest of the cricket fraternity. This changed cricket forever and MCC remains the sole custodian of laws governing cricket to this day. </p>

              <h2>19th Century</h2>
              <p>Cricket underwent two major transformations in this century. While traditionally a ball was bowled under-arm to a batter, the idea of side arm and then later over-arm took hold in cricket. The variations and the advantages of bowling overarm were never explored until one day a lady cricketer decided to bowl with a side-arm action so as not to rumple her skirt. It was just a matter of time before this led to over-arm bowling being the norm as we know it today. Second was the bursting of cricket's first superstar, WG Grace, on the scene. Grace developed and influenced the batting technique of all that came after him and is often called the father of modern batting technique.</p>

              <h2>20th Century</h2>
              <p>Cricket's evolution continued in the 20th century as the game flourished on either sides of the two World Wars. At first, the invention of radio and then television enabled cricket to reach wider audience than ever before. The last quarter of the century saw the first ever worldcups being organized in women's and then men's game while Kerry Packer's World Series paved a new path by bringing innovations such as day-night matches and colored clothing. In the late 1990s, cricket was hit by allegations of match-fixing with several prominent players being found guilty. While commercialization brought new opportunities, the game paid the ultimate price by losing its innocence.</p>

              <h2>Present</h2>
              <p>The emergence of T20 format in early 2000s revolutionized the game one more time. A T20 game can be completed inside 3.5 hours and so it became an instant hit in the era of shorter attention spans and instant gratification. Nothing epitomizes T20 cricket more than the IPL, a cash-rich franchise cricket league in India, known for attracting the best talent from all over the world. While several pundits have warned that T20s will bring an end to cricket's longer formats, both ODIs and Test cricket remain popular with Test cricket enjoying a resurgence of sorts in the last few years.</p>
